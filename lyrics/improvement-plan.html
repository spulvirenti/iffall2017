				The refinement process for my lyrics page mostly consisted of maintaining a clearer sense of a grid. My partners and I agreed that, to gain coherency, my page needed to have a stronger underlying structure before I could allude to a vague tone of distortion and loss-of-clarity. Given my song is quite moody in its recounting of an unstable, off-and-on relationship, my partners were content with my color choice and general composition. Parts of the composition that we saw to be inconsistent and unclear to the removed viewer were the title placement and scale, the overwhelming presence of the album art, and the leading of the lyrics type. <strong>Thus, the main points I edited were my grid system, the hierarchy of my type, and the relationship of my image in relation to the lyrics.</strong>
