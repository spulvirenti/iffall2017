			<h1>Feedback for Gracie </h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Nice use of negative space.</li> 
				<li>Maybe consider giving the type a stronger presence through factors like scale, color and/or tracking the letters out.</li>
				<li>The design aesthetic is consistent with the content in which its representing, which is impressive!!</li>
				<li>Strong use of analogous colors, but more dramatic shifts in scale of the images might make the transitions more unpredictable and, thus, intriguing.</li>
				<li>I also like the flat background colors because of their consistent language with the characters and the show they are pulled from.</li>
				<li>I also think, however, that playing with shapes or other variables in the background (i.e. speaking to the treatment of shadows/ highlights in the figure illustrations) might make it slightly more dimensional.</li> 
				<li>The transitions seem relatively simple and achievable!</li>
