			<div class="title">[Verse 1]</strong></div>
			<br />
			Hello there
			<br />
			The angel from my nightmare
			<br />
			The shadow in the background of the morgue
			<br />
			The unsuspecting victim 
			<br />
			Of darkness in the valley
			<br />
			We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
			<br />
			Where you can always find me
			<br />
			And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
			<br />
			And in the night we'll wish this never ends
			<br />
			We'll wish this never ends
		</p>

			<span class="verse">I miss you, I miss you</span>

		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="title">[Verse 2]</strong></div>
			<br />
			Where are you?
			<br />
			And I'm so sorry
			<br />
			I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
			<br />
			I need somebody and always
			<br />
			This sick strange darkness
			<br />
			Comes creeping on so haunting every time
			<br />
			And as I stared I counted
			<br />
			The Webs from all the spiders
			<br />
			Catching things and eating their insides
			<br />
			Like indecision to call you
			<br />
			And hear your voice of treason
			<br />
			Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
			<br />
			Stop this pain tonight
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="title">[Chorus]</strong></div>
			<br />
			Don't waste your time on me
			<br />
			You're already the voice inside my head
			<br />
			<span class="verse">(I miss you, I miss you)</span>
			<br />
			<br />
			Don't waste your time on me 
			<br />
			You're already the voice inside my head 
			<br />
			<span class="verse">(I miss you, I miss you)</span>

			<span class="title">[Chorus]</strong></span>
			<br />
			<span class="break">[3x]</strong></span>
			<br />
			Don't waste your time on me
			<br />
			You're already the voice inside my head
			<br />
			<span class="verse">(I miss you, I miss you)</span>
		</p>
		<p>
